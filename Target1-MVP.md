**Target 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

Start Date: May 18, 2020

The idea I had for the first target of the project refers to a design concept called the 'minimum viable product.' Just to get us used to the feel of working in a group environment, I believe I have set some simple goals that would create the minimum starting point for each task group.

Database @Li 
- I would like you to look into starting an entity-relationship diagram (aka entity-relationship model)
  - We should have a map of users, and they should have login info and contact info.

API Developers @Alex  & @Dakota
- I would like you to sign up for SwaggerHub ( https://swagger.io/ )
  - Create a new API, invite the team members, and try adding a few API calls that represent our expected needs.
  - These API functions don't need to have any functionality yet, it's just to get used to the system.

Front End Developers @Idel  & @Mason 
- I would like you to work on creating a landing page that confirms a login (likely hardcoded)

I believe these targets are pretty short-term, and should be simple. This is just to get everyone (including me!) used to the feel of finding project targets, setting targets, and checking in on their progress.
