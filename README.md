### Welcome!

This is the Github page for the COP4331 'Small Project', specifically for **Group #21**.

Tasks will be divided out and listed utilizing the Discord handles from the main chat.

### Useful resources
We have a [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) style project board [located here.](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/SmallProject/projects) This is how I plan to track our milestone progress, assign tasks, and make note of any issues that arise. 
We also have a [Project Wiki](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/SmallProject/wiki) which will provide long-term task lists, and useful information to help you complete your individual tasks.

**All Users** ( @All )
 - It is recommended to add this repo to your watchlist, so you receive notifications of remote changes.
 - Make sure to set up a local LAMP or WAMP stack for testing purposes!
 - Make sure to clone this repository, so you can maintain a local copy of the project while working
   - Testing and development should be done *locally*, deployment will be handled when we have changes that need to be tested remotely (or submitting the project.)

**Project Manager** ( @Curtis )
 - [ ] Ensure users understand how to utilize Github to work on the project (clone a repo, pull requests)
