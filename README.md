### Welcome!

This is the Github page for the COP4331 'Small Project', specifically for **Group #21**.

Tasks will be divided out and listed utilizing the Discord handles from the main chat.

### Changes for Target 2

1. The Target2 branch has been created, and set as the default branch.
2. More frequent commits have been requested
3. Project targets have been updated to reflect our rate of progress thus far.

### Useful resources
We have a [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) style project board [located here.](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/SmallProject/projects) This is how I plan to track our milestone progress, assign tasks, and make note of any issues that arise. 
We also have a [Project Wiki](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/SmallProject/wiki) which will provide long-term task lists, and useful information to help you complete your individual tasks.
